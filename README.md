# Localize-Swift
Localize-Swift is a Swift framework that improves i18n and localization with cleaner syntax and in-app language switching.

### Setting up with Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that automates the process of adding frameworks to your Cocoa application.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Localize-Swift into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "marmelroy/Localize-Swift"
```
